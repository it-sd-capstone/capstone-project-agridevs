## Overview
The Profit Map Web App aims to help farmers visualize profitability using yield data mapped onto satellite imagery. 
Users can upload CSV files, which are then processed to generate a map with an overlaid color gradient.

## To-Do List
- [ ] Finish README to include setup/validate/access (Module 3.1 Due Mon Nov 11)
- [ ] Although test-db was created, make sure we can actually connect to our profitmap db
- [ ] Set up spot for credentials like tokens or websites to ensure group has access at all times

## Ideas
- Consider allowing users to upload CSV files to visualize yield data on a satellite image background.
- Possible technologies: Mapbox, D3.js for visualizations, GeoJSON for geospatial data.
